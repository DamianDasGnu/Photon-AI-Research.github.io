excerpt: 'We will be introducing invertible surrogate models that approximate complex forward simulation of the physics involved in laser plasma accelerators: iLWFA. The bijective design of the surrogate model also provides all means for reconstruction of experimentally acquired diagnostics. The quality of our invertible laser wakefield acceleration network will be verified on a large set of numerical LWFA simulations.'
