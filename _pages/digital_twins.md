Study of laser plasma acceleration processes addresses high requirements to the technical equipment and time consumption in numerical and 
experimental research. A demand on statistical and mathematical methods for inversion of the system state, 
comprehension of measurement data and quantification of data stability can only be done by a comprehensive 
machine learning based surrogate model for Laser-driven Plasma Accelerators.

This surrogate potentially accelerates **theoretical comprehension of the beamline**, 
in terms of design space exploration and promises reliable in-situ analysis of experimental data which leads novel guidance mechanisms for 
future Laser-driven Plasma Accelerators. The main aim of our work is to elaborate surrogate models for Free Electron Laser by virtue of that one could 
unveil beam dynamics(in terms of particle data) on the scope of collected diagnostic. 

Achieved results for the first stage of FEL: acceleration of particles in LWFA regime, demonstrate ability to learn an approximation of data-dependent posterior distribution 
by conditional inventible neural networks. The further derived model is able to describe an electron bunch transformation in the  FEL beam transport in 
terms of phase space particle distribution based on its initial parameters: divergence and size. This step opens a perspective to a potential 
elaborated model that could use obtained diagnostics for reconstruction of beam at any point in the FEL.
