We are continuously looking for students who want to do their **student project** or **thesis about surrogate modeling & inverse imaging problems** in our lab. Please message [Nico](mailto:n.hoffmann@hzdr.de) for details!

You are looking for a **ML engineer** or **PostDoc position** on the same tasks at HZDR? Feel free to get in touch with us as there might be several opportunities for you.
