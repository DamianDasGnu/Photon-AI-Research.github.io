We are continuously looking for students who want to do their **thesis** or **student project** in our lab **about surrogate modeling & inverse imaging problems**. Please message [Nico](mailto:n.hoffmann@hzdr.de) for details!

You are looking for a **ML engineer** or **PostDoc position** on the same tasks at HZDR? Feel free to get in touch with us as there might be several opportunities for you.
